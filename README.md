# Deepfake-face-generation-using-Autoencoders

In this project, I have used the Celeba dataset and have trained an encoder and decoder based on these images.<br>
The current model available here has a val_loss of 0.07955 on the celeba dataset.<br>
The code titled Deepfake_Image_Generation.ipynb is a code to generate random images of people who have never existed before given a particular face as input.<br>

  I have also created just a deep fake of Logan Paul's video titled 'So Sorry'. Video analysis has been implemented on this video along with the use of autoencoders.
  The downloaded video is available here and also, the link to the weights is available in my repository too. Also, you can view/download the video I have used in this case from the files I have uploaded.<br>
  Please feel free to fork it and work on it as required.

  The same has been implemented for PewDiePie's video titled 'My Response'. 
  The link to the weights in this case is available too and the required video can be viewed too.
