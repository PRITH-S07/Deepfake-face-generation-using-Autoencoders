# Deepfake-face-generation-using-Autoencoders

In this project, I have used the Celeba dataset and have trained an encoder and decoder based on these images.<br>
The current model available here has a val_loss of 0.07955 on the celeba dataset.<br>
The code titled Deepfake_Image_Generation.ipynb is a code to generate random images of people who have never existed before given a particular face as input.
